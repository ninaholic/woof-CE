# CONFIG_X86_INTEL_PSTATE is not set
====================================

  May 2013: intel devs say stop using on demand
  https://plus.google.com/+TheodoreTso/posts/2vEekAsG2QT

  norgo reports issues with modern intel processors
  https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93521

  So at least disabling INTEL_PSTATE for older kernels makes sense (4.1-).


shared memfd open() failed: Function not implemented
====================================================

  This error means you should use kernel 3.17+

    memfd is a kernel feature (introduced in version 3.17) to allocate temporary files
    that do not depend on /tmp or /dev/shm. More info:

forcepae kernel param
=====================

  It first appeared in k3.15:
     http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt?v=3.15
 
  It looks like there's no need to produce non-pae kernels anymore because
  even ancient cpus support PAE... even some cpus that don't report
  the PAE flag (Pentium M, Celeron M cpus):
  
  > Many Pentium M systems disable PAE but may have a functionally usable PAE
  > implementation. This adds the "forcepae" parameter which bypasses the boot
  > check for PAE, and sets the CPU as being PAE capable. Using this parameter
  > will taint the kernel with TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC.
